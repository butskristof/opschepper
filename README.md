## Introduction 
This is a website for a young startup battling food waste. 

## Technical 
This website uses elements from the HTML5 boilerplate, to which the Bootstrap 4 framework was added. HTML5 and CSS3 design principles were taken into account as much as possible.  
Server-side, the Plates framework is used for templating. The website is designed to run on an Apache server, hence the `.htaccess` file.
